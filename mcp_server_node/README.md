# Pizzaz MCP server (Node)

This directory contains a minimal Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implemented with the official TypeScript SDK. The server exposes the full suite of Pizzaz demo widgets so you can experiment with UI-bearing tools in ChatGPT developer mode.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm, npm, or yarn for dependency management

## Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

If you prefer npm or yarn, adjust the command accordingly.

## Run the server

```bash
pnpm start
```

The script bootstraps the server over stdio, which makes it compatible with the MCP Inspector as well as ChatGPT connectors. Once running you can list the tools and invoke any of the pizza experiences.

Each tool responds with:

- `content`: a short text confirmation that mirrors the original Pizzaz examples.
- `structuredContent`: a small JSON payload that echoes the topping argument, demonstrating how to ship data alongside widgets.
- `_meta.openai/outputTemplate`: metadata that binds the response to the matching Skybridge widget shell.

Feel free to extend the handlers with real data sources, authentication, and persistence.
